//some notes let's go redux

//for projects with simpler global state, context is easier than redux.
//if it's more complicated, use redux.
//for projects with more sophisticated global state requirements, Redux remains a popular option. Redux offers greater flexibility with support for middleware and richer developer tools in the form of the Redux DevTools.
